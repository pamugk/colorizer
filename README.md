# Black-white photo colorization

## Scientific basis

The colorization algorithm was developed by Zhang, et al, and is detailed here:

http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/

## PyImageSearch

The algorithm implementation is taken from here:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/25/black-and-white-image-colorization-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/ 

## Pre-trained data, inspiration etc

Inspiration, data etc is taken from here: https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI-Photo-Colorizer

## Tech & tools

The app itself is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The following libs & frameworks are used: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [PySide 6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/).

There are plans to use [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) for app compilation.
